 <h5>  
  The snow leopard, known for its beautiful, thick fur, has a white, yellowish or soft gray coat with ringed spots of black on brown. <br> The markings help camouflage it from prey. <br> With their thick coats, heavy fur-lined tails and paws covered with fur, snow leopards are perfectly adapted to the cold and dry habitats in which they live. <br>
  For many centuries this magnificent cat was the king of the mountains. <br> The mountains were rich with their prey such as wild sheep, ibex, marmots and hares. <br> Snow leopards are found in twelve countries including China, India, Pakistan and Russia however, their population is dropping at an alarming rate.
   <h5>

   <li><h5>Armed Conflict</li>
   <li><h5>Scarce Prey</li>
