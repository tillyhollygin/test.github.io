	Seven different species of marine turtle grace our ocean waters, from the shallow seagrass beds of the Indian Ocean, to the colorful reefs of the Coral Triangle, and even the sandy beaches of the Eastern Pacific. </br>
	Charities, such as <abbr title="Worldwide Fund for Nature">WWF</abbr>, focus on five of those species: green, hawksbill, loggerhead, leatherback and olive ridley.</br>
    Human activities have tipped the scales against the survival of these ancient mariners. Nearly all species of sea turtle are classified as Endangered.</br>
	Slaughtered for their eggs, meat, skin and shells, sea turtles suffer from poaching and over-exploitation. They also face habitat destruction and accidental capture in fishing gear.<br>
	Climate change has an impact on turtle nesting sites. It alters sand temperatures, which then affects the sex of hatchlings. </br>

	<p><h4> Turtles are also in danger due to masses of plastic waste being dumped in our oceans each year as they can not always see the difference between plastic waste and food. Scientists believe that the turtles mistake plastic shopping bags for jellyfish; one of their common prey.<br>
	    Greenpeace does however think that this damage can be reversed. A spokesperson from the charity says <q><i>we have a chance to make huge progress in the fight against plastic pollution<i></q></p>
